  <para>Similar to <methodname>has_many</methodname> (see <xref
  linkend="activerecord_has_many"/>), the method
  <methodname>has_one</methodname> also creates a logical relation between two
  models. But in contrast to <methodname>has_many,</methodname> one record is
  only ever associated with exactly one other record in
  <methodname>has_one</methodname>. <emphasis>In most practical cases of
  application, it logically makes sense to put both into the same model and
  therefore the same database table, but for the sake of completeness I also
  want to discuss <methodname>has_one</methodname> here.</emphasis><tip>
      <para>You can probably safely skip <methodname>has_one</methodname>
      without losing any sleep.</para>
    </tip></para>

  <para>In the examples, I assume that you have already read and understood
  <xref linkend="activerecord_has_many"/>. I am not going to explain methods
  like <methodname>build</methodname> (<xref
  linkend="activerecord_hinzufuegen_build"/>) again but assume that you
  already know the basics.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Preparation</title>

    <para>We use the example from the Rails documentation (see <uri
    xlink:href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html</uri>)
    and create an application containing employees and offices. Each employee
    has an office. First the application:<screen>$ rails new office-space
  [...]
$ cd office-space
$</screen></para>

    <para>And now the two models:<screen>$ rails generate model employee last_name
  [...]
$ rails generate model office location employee_id:integer
  [...]
$ rake db:migrate
  [...]
$</screen></para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Association</title>

    <para>The association in the file
    <filename>app/model/employee.rb:</filename><programlisting>class Employee &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :last_name

  has_one :office
end</programlisting></para>

    <para>And its counterpart in the file
    <filename>app/model/office.rb:</filename><programlisting>class Office &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :employee_id, :location

  belongs_to :employee
end</programlisting></para>

    <section>
      <title>Options</title>

      <para>The options of <methodname>has_one</methodname> are similar to
      those of <methodname>has_many</methodname>. So for details, please refer
      to <xref linkend="activerecord_1n_optionen"/> or <uri
      xlink:href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_one">http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Associations/ClassMethods.html#method-i-has_one</uri>.

    <title>Console Examples</title>

    <para>Let's start the console and create two employees:<screen>$ rails console

    <para>For the second employee, we use the automatically generated method

    <title>has_one vs. belongs_to</title>

    <para>Both <methodname>has_one</methodname> and
    <methodname>belongs_to</methodname> offer the option of representing a 1:1
    relationship. The difference in practice is in the programmer's personal
    preference and the location of the foreign key. In general,
    <methodname>has_one</methodname> tends to be used rarely and depends on
    the degree of normalization of the data schema.</para>
