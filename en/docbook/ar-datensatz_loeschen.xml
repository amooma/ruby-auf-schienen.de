  <title>Removing a Record</title>

  <para>To remove a database record, you have the methods
  <methodname>destroy</methodname> and <methodname>delete</methodname>. It's
  quite easy to confuse these two terms, but they are different and after a
  while you get used to it.</para>

  <para>As an example, we use the following Rails application:<screen>$ rails new bookshelf
  [...]
$ cd bookshelf
$ rails generate model book title
  [...]
$ rails generate model author book_id:integer first_name last_name
  [...]
$ rake db:migrate
  [...]
$</screen></para>

  <para><filename>app/models/book.rb</filename><programlisting>class Book &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :title

  has_many :authors, :dependent =&gt; :destroy
end</programlisting></para>

  <para><filename>app/models/author.rb</filename><programlisting>class Author &lt; ActiveRecord::Base
  attr_accessible :book_id, :first_name, :last_name

  belongs_to :book
end</programlisting></para>

  <section xml:id="activerecord_destroy">
    <title xml:id="activerecord_destroy.title">destroy</title>

    <indexterm>
      <primary>ActiveRecord</primary>

      <secondary>methods</secondary>

      <tertiary>destroy()</tertiary>
    </indexterm>

    <para>With <methodname>destroy</methodname> you can remove a record and
    any existing dependencies are also taken into account (see for example
    <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code> in <xref
    linkend="activerecord_1n_optionen"/>). Simply put: to be on the safe side,
    it's better to use <methodname>destroy</methodname> because then the Rails
    system does more for you.</para>

    <para>Let's create a record and then destroy it again:<screen>$ rails console
Loading development environment (Rails 3.2.9)
&gt;&gt; book = Book.create(title: 'Homo faber')

    <para>As we are using the option <code>:dependent =&gt; :destroy</code> in

    <para>When removing records, please always remember that there is a
    difference between the content of the database and the value of the
    currently removed object. The instance is <foreignphrase
    xml:lang="en">frozen</foreignphrase> after removing the database field. So
    it is no longer in the database, but still present in the program, yet it
    can no longer be modified there. It is read-only. To check, you can use
    the method <indexterm>
        <primary>frozen?()</primary>
      </indexterm><methodname>frozen?</methodname>:<screen>&gt;&gt; book = Book.create(title: 'Homo faber')

    <para>The record has been removed from the database, but the object with
    all its data is still present in the running Ruby program. So could we
    then revive the entire record? The answer is yes, but it will then be a
    new record:<screen>&gt;&gt; Book.create(title: book.title)

    <para>As with <methodname>destroy</methodname>, an object also gets frozen
    when you use <methodname>delete</methodname> (see <xref
