  </note>

  <para>One of the recipes for the success of Rails is surely the fact that is
  uses <literal>ActiveRecord</literal>. The programming and use <quote>feels
  good</quote> and it is much less susceptible to errors than pure SQL. When
  working with this chapter, it helps if you have some knowledge of SQL, but
  this is not required and also not essential for working with
  <literal>ActiveRecord</literal>.</para>

  <para>Just as an aside, let me mention that you are not obliged to work with
  ActiveRecord when working with Rails. You can also use other ORMs.
  ActiveRecord is the default and is used by the majority of all Rails
  developers.</para>

  <section xml:id="activerecord-howto-zum-kapitel">
    <title>Howto for this Chapter</title>

    <para>This chapter is a self-contained unit. But the information provided
    in <xref linkend="ruby-grundlagen"/> and <xref
    linkend="erste_schritte_mit_rails"/> is required. Without this basic
    knowledge, you will not have any fun with this chapter!</para>

    <para>Rails newbies should read this chapter once from beginning to end.
    Please take your time. This chapter is important!</para>

    <para><note>
        <para>This chapter is only about ActiveRecord. So I am not going to
        integrate any tests (see <xref linkend="testing"/>), to keep the
        examples as clear as possible.</para>
      </note></para>

    <section xml:id="activerecord-keine-lust-auf-sql">
      <title>Not in the Mood for SQL?</title>

      <para>Occasionally, I will discuss SQL code created by ActiveRecord
      methods. If you are not interested in SQL: just read over it and don't
      worry. The beauty of ActiveRecord is that you do not need to think about
      it. For everyone else, my comments provide better understanding of the
      optimization processes going on in the background.</para>

      <para>This book is aimed at beginners. So this chapter describes the
      basics for using ActiveRecord. I could easily have written a book twice
      as thick as this one on ActiveRecord alone. I hope this chapter will get
      you hooked and encourage you to find out more about this topic on your
      own in the Rails documentations (see <xref
      linkend="weiterfuehrende_doku"/>).</para>

      <tip>
        <para>One of my best buddies when developing Rails applications is the
        Tab key. Whenever you are looking for a method for a particular
        problem, recreate it in the Rails console and then press the Tab key
        twice to list all available methods for the corresponding class. The
        names of the methods are usually self-exlanatory.</para>
