    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>Don't let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easly
    to learn. It is not! It is the best and most effective Framework to
    develop webapplications but it is hard to understand in the beginning. The
    worst mistake of all is to not learn Ruby before diving into Ruby on
    Rails. Believe me. I made this one myself. You can understand PHP by
    reading it but you should learn Ruby before reading any code of a Ruby on
    Rails project.</para>

    <para>This book starts with the basics of Ruby (<xref
    linkend="ruby-grundlagen"/>). You will not become a Ruby guru after
    reading it but you'll understand the basic ideas and that is important. It
    is probalby wise to redo all code examples by yourself. By playing with
    the code snippets you'll learn the most.</para>

    <para>I try to give each reader a sense of achievement as soon as possible
    by diving into creating a Rails application right after the <xref
    linkend="ruby-grundlagen"/> chapter. Anyhow you'll have to invest a couple
    of hours probably a couple of days. It takes time to understand and feel
    the magic of Ruby on Rails. But once it happens you'll a lost soul for
    Java and PHP. ;-)</para>

    <para>The book is written in a way that you can and actually should read
    it from the first to the last page. But is is also written like a cookbook
    with a lot of photos of the process. The photos are of course not photos
    but code examples. Anyhow each recipe works for it self. Once you
    understand the concept of cooking you don't have to start with the first
    recipe. You can dive into baking a cheesecake right away.</para>

    <para>Please do me a favour and tell other people about this book. Help to
    spread the word by Twitter, Facebook and other social media plattforms.
    And please do not hesitate to send me feedback by e-mail to
    <email>stefan.wintermeyer@amooma.de</email> or Twitter (<uri

    It helps me a lot to improve my work.</para>
