# Preface

Do not let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easily to learn.
It is not! It is probably the best and most effective Framework to develop web
applications but it is hard to understand in the beginning. The worst mistake of
all is to not learn the basics of Ruby before diving into Ruby on Rails. I made
this one myself. This book starts with the basics of Ruby. You will not become a
Ruby guru after reading it but you'll understand the basic ideas and that is
important.

The book is written in a way that you can and actually should read it from the
first to the last page. But is is also written like a cookbook with a lot of
photos of the process. The photos are of course not photos but code examples.
Anyhow each recipe works for it self. Once you understand the concept of cooking
you don't have to start with the first recipe. You can dive into baking a
cheesecake right away.

If you like this book: Please do me a favor and rate it on Amazon.com.

Thank you!
