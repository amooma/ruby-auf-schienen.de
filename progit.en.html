<p>Do not let people fool you into believing that Ruby on Rails is easly to
learn. It is not! It is probably the best and most effective Framework
to develop webapplications but it is hard to understand in the
beginning. The worst mistake of all is to not learn Ruby before diving
into Ruby on Rails. I made this one myself. This book starts with the
basics of Ruby. You will not become a Ruby guru after reading it but
you'll understand the basic ideas and that is important.</p>

<p>The book is written in a way that you can and actually should read it
from the first to the last page. But is is also written like a cookbook
with a lot of photos of the process. The photos are of course not photos
but code examples. Anyhow each recipe works for it self. Once you
understand the concept of cooking you don't have to start with the first
recipe. You can dive into baking a cheesecake right away.</p>

<p>If you like this book: Please do me a favour and rate it on Amazon.com.
Thank you!</p>
